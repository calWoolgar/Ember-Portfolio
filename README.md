# portfolio

This is my application written in Ember which I'm going to use to show off my Javascript skills and to create a portfolio about myself.

The reason that I'm creating this site is because I want to show my self that I can build an application from start to finish and deploy it to the internet for everyone to see. Not only is it so that I can build an application, but one using Ember, then Angular, then React. This will also help improve my JavaScript skills.

## SCSS

Using ember-cli-sass for the css preprocessing to allow for nesting, mixings, variables and inheritance.
