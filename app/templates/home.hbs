        <p class="text-block">Hello! My name is Callam Woolgar and I'm a Full-Stack Developer from Oxfordshire, England.
            I work for a company called Adactus and for them I create frontend and backend code for our clients.
            I choose being a software developer as my career because I love technology and the convenience that it brings to the world.
